Welcome to JavaInvaders!

This project is a remake of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The point of the game is to eliminate all the enemies on the screen without getting eliminated.

To run this program: 
1. simply download the src folder. This will include the App.java file which allows the user to play the game, and also includes a sub folder called Icons which includes the background image, enemy and player images. 
2. Once both have been downloaded, launch these in Visual Studio code under a new project, and add the App.java file, Icons folder to the project work space. You will also need to reference the javafx libraries to allow this to run properly. The libraries referenced is just the standard jar libraries from the JavaFX download. This can be found when you search for JavaFX download. Install these and reference the jar libaries in the project created.
3. From here, all that is left is to configure your launch.Json settings, and add a VMArgs statement at the bottom. Refer to the .vscode file and the launch.Json settings here, it may even be beneficial to copy this statement into your own Json settings and replace the file path with your own based on where javaFX is on your system. 
4. After, simply click run in the top right of VS code (looks like a play button) and the game will launch!

To play:
Once you are in the game, it will fullscreen automatically, to leave the program, press escape and then close the window to stop the program. 
The controls for this game are simple:
Pressing A will move your charecter to the left.
Pressing D will move your charecter to the right.
Pressing Space will make your charecter shoot.

Have Fun and Goodluck!
